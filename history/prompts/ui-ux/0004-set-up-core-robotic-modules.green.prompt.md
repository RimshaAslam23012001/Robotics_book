## Prompt

Core robotic modules section to set up and display in card style

## Response snapshot

Updated the core robotic modules section to properly display all 4 main modules (Communication Architecture, Virtual Environment, Perception & Navigation, and VLA System) with appropriate card styling, progress indicators, and descriptive content.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Core robotic modules now properly displayed in a structured card layout with accurate module names
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Modified HomepageFeatures.js to update module content and styling
- 🔁 Next prompts: none
- 🧠 Reflection: Structured curriculum display helps users understand the learning path

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Add links to module pages from the cards
