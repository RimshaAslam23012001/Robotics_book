### Title: APA Citation Style Requirement

### Context:
The "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" book aims to be a credible and authoritative resource. Proper academic citation is essential to uphold technical accuracy, acknowledge sources, and enable readers to delve deeper into referenced material. The project Constitution mandates either APA or IEEE citation format.

### Decision:
The book will exclusively use the **APA (American Psychological Association) 7th Edition citation style** for all references, in-text citations, and bibliographies. This provides a consistent and widely recognized academic standard for the technical content.

### Alternatives Considered:
*   **IEEE Citation Style**: Another widely accepted style in engineering and computer science.
*   **MLA Citation Style**: More commonly used in humanities.
*   **Chicago Manual of Style**: Used across various disciplines, often for historical or social sciences.
*   **Informal Linking**: Relying only on hyperlinks without formal citation formatting.

### Pros & Cons:
*   **APA 7th Edition**:
    *   **Pros**: Highly structured and clear. Widely recognized in academic publishing. Supports clear attribution and easy source lookup. Promotes consistency across the book, fulfilling a Constitution principle. Well-documented guidelines are readily available.
    *   **Cons**: Can be perceived as verbose compared to numerical styles (like IEEE) for in-text citations. Requires careful attention to detail to avoid errors.
*   **IEEE Citation Style**:
    *   **Pros**: Numeric in-text citations are concise, common in engineering fields, good for quick reference in technical documents.
    *   **Cons**: Less emphasis on author/date in-text, which can sometimes make it harder to immediately identify the source context without referring to the bibliography.
*   **Informal Linking**:
    *   **Pros**: Simplest for online content.
    *   **Cons**: Lacks academic rigor, not suitable for a formal educational textbook, makes it difficult to track and verify sources consistently.

### Impact:
*   All authors and contributors will be required to adhere strictly to APA 7th edition guidelines for all research, in-text citations, and the reference list.
*   The quality validation process (Section 4 of the plan) will include checks for APA compliance.
*   Claude Code automation (Section 7 and 8 of the plan) may include tools or scripts to assist with citation management and formatting.

### Risks:
*   **Manual Error**: APA style requires meticulous attention, increasing the risk of citation errors if done manually. Mitigation involves using citation management tools and rigorous proofreading.
*   **Author Familiarity**: Some authors might be more familiar with IEEE or other styles. Mitigation involves providing clear APA guidelines and examples within the project documentation.

### Rationale for Chosen Decision:
APA 7th Edition was chosen for its widespread academic acceptance, clear structure, and the emphasis it places on author and date for in-text citations, which is beneficial for a technical book discussing evolving research. This choice ensures consistency, credibility, and ease of reference for readers, directly supporting the "Citation & Sources" and "Technical Accuracy" principles outlined in the project Constitution.

### Status: Accepted
