# AI/Spec-Driven Book Creation — A Complete Book on Humanoid Robots using Docusaurus, Spec-Kit Plus, and Claude Code, deployed on GitHub Pages.

## Core Principles

### Technical Accuracy
Every chapter must be based on verified, up-to-date, and reliable technical knowledge about humanoid robots, AI systems, sensors, locomotion, architecture, ethics, hardware, software, and real-world applications.

### Clarity for Global Readers
Content must be understandable for:

High-school to university-level readers
Tech learners, robotics beginners, and AI enthusiasts

### Structured Learning
Book must follow a progressive, chapter-based structure with increasing complexity (Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced robotics concepts).

### Educational Value First
Focus on teaching, diagrams, examples, real-world case studies, workflows, and comparisons.

### Reproducibility & Transparency
Technical workflows, robot architectures, and algorithms must be reproducible, referenced, and clearly explained.

## Key Standards

### Writing Style:
Clear, simple English
Short paragraphs
Code, diagrams, tables allowed
Consistent formatting following Docusaurus Markdown standards

### Citation & Sources:
All factual claims require citations
Use APA or IEEE citation format
Prefer robotics journals, IEEE papers, academic sources
Include links to credible sources (research labs, robotics companies, NASA, Boston Dynamics, Nvidia, Toyota, Honda)

### Content Depth:
Each topic must include:
Definitions
Real-world applications
Technical explanation
Diagrams / pseudo-code where needed
Latest advancements up to 2025

### Structure Requirements:
Every chapter must contain:
Introduction
Explanations
Technical deep dive
Examples or case studies
Summary
References

### Book Format:
Must be structured for Docusaurus
Includes sidebar navigation
Modular MDX pages
Ready for GitHub Pages deployment

## Constraints

Target Word Count: 12,000 – 20,000 words
Total Chapters: 10 – 15 chapters
Minimum Sources: 20 credible sources
Zero Plagiarism (strict paraphrasing + original explanations)
All images must be AI-generated or your own (no copyrighted material)
All code blocks must be verifiable
Use only Markdown (.md / .mdx)

## Success Criteria

A book is considered complete when:
All chapters are written, structured, and internally consistent
All factual statements are cited with credible robotic/AI sources
Sidebars, navigation, and page hierarchy are correct
Build passes Docusaurus static build with no errors
Book deploys successfully to GitHub Pages
Readable on mobile and desktop
Zero plagiarism
Follows the Constitution standards strictly
Meets educational clarity — any non-expert can understand
Content approved by automated Spec-Kit validation prompts

## Optional Enhancements (if you want in future):

Add interactive diagrams (Mermaid.js)
Add code examples in Python, ROS2, or C++
Add timeline of humanoid robot evolution
Add glossary of robotics terms
Add quizzes or knowledge checks per chapter

## Governance
This Constitution supersedes all other practices. Amendments require documentation, approval, and a migration plan. All PRs/reviews must verify compliance. Complexity must be justified.
